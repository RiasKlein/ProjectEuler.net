### About this Repo

Solving the problems on projecteuler.net can be a challenging task and sometimes, I may use techniques or approaches 
that I may want to refer to at a later time. The reason this repo exists is so I can easily see how I
approached a certain type of problem in the future.

The solutions available here are by no means the most efficient; actually, some of them may be pretty inefficient.
My goal is to write programs that can solve the problems and finish in a reasonable time. My initial timing 
standard is having the program complete within a few seconds. This may change as the problems become more difficult.

**If you want to use any or all of the solutions for your own projecteuler account**, feel free to do so. Personally,
I believe that the fun is getting to a solution with your own programming skills and knowledge. If you just want to
"solve" all of the problems by copy and pasting answers, that's your choice ...
